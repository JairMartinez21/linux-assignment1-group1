What is the difference between the Linux kernel and the shell?
The Linux kernel is the core of the operating system that manages the hardware and system resources. 
The shell is the program that lets the user interact with the system by typing commands, which are then sent to the kernel to execute.

Explain the difference between an absolute path and a relative path with one example of each.
An absolute path shows the full location of a file or folder starting from the root directory /. 
For example, /home/user/docs/file.txt is an absolute path. A relative path shows the location based on where you currently are in the system. 
For example, docs/file.txt is a relative path if you are in the /home/user/ folder.

The core components of Linux?
The main parts of Linux are the kernel, the shell, and the file system. 
The kernel handles the hardware, the shell lets users run commands, and the file system organizes data in folders and files. 
These components work together to make the system usable.
